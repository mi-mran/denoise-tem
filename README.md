# Analysis of TEM Data Using Machine Learning Methods

denoise-tem is a collection of methods used in denoising transmission electron microscopy (TEM) frames and video sequences. Methods are tested and compared. Details of each test can be found within the respective folders.

## Objective

The objective of the project is to achieve denoised frames / video sequences whereby vesicles can be distinguished from the background and the noise due to the low dosage of electrons during image acquisition. Ultimately, once the vesicles can be observed, changes in vesicle size / structure are to be observed while varying the surrounding temperature.

## Folder Structure

1. spatial_denoise (methods used for denoising single frames)
2. temporal_denoise (methods used for denoising video sequences)
3. utils (contains scripts for data / image manipulation / visualisation)
