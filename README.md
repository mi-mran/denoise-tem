# Analysis of TEM Data Using Machine Learning Methods

denoise-tem is a collection of methods used in denoising transmission electron microscopy frames and video sequences. Methods are tested and compared. Details of each test can be found within the respective folders.

## Folder Structure

1. spatial_denoise (methods used for denoising single frames)
2. temporal_denoise (methods used for denoising video sequences)
3. utils (contains scripts for data / image manipulation / visualisation)
