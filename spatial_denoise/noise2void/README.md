# Noise2Void: Learning Denoising from Single Noisy Images
## Summary
Building from the unsupervised nature of Noise2Noise, this model denoises single noisy images. The assumption made is that the value of a single clean pixel can be reasonably predicted from the clean neighbouring pixels, whereas it is not possible to predict the value of a single noisy pixel from the noisy neighbouring pixels. It is also assumed that the image contains per pixel noise. The model employs a blind spot, where the single pixel to be predicted is omitted as input, but is included in the target output. By doing this, the receptive field is unable to learn the identity simply from the input pixel, but is forced to use the surrounding pixels to learn the target pixel value. Combining this blind spot receptive field and the assumptions made, the model should be able to predict clean pixels, but should not be able to do the same for noisy pixels.
